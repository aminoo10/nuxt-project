## AMLookup

A simple Anime/Manga Database Website that queries for Anime or Manga Title listings and displays information about them. 

Utilizing the Unofficial MyAnimeList API Jikan (https://jikan.moe/)

## How to use:

* Type in 3 characters or less into the search bar, select your desired search-type with the toggle button (Anime or Manga), and surely your results should be populated on the page!

* From the results page, view more about a title by clicking on its name, will bring you to a dedicated title page.

* Click the recommendations page to see listing recommendations from the web master!



## Notes: 

* Sometimes some queries may not be relevant to what was searched, as more listings are returned, the less relevant they will become, this is due part I believe to the nature of the API, but it's not too detrimental of an issue as it still works perfectly fine for searching a specific title. 

* By default, NSFW queries are **filtered out**.
