SEO and analytics: 

SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization, and it is how developers get search engines such as Google to rank the placement of your website when querying for search results. Google specifically changes its rank placement algorithm often.

SEO looks for information in H1 tags, and then works down to H6, there should only be one H1 tag per page, more than that and your SEO rank may go down. Hidden text and ghost pages added for the purpose of improving your SEO score will also result in docking of points.

Backlinks (links to and out of your website) can help with your SEO ranking when they are legitimate and content-based. (filling your website with links randomly won't help) Quality links combined with good content and strucutre can lead to good search results. If you have used SEO correctly, you will receive a lot of organic internet traffic. You can track company/website click results through a KPI (Key Preformance Index), and with using a database to capture information or by using Google Analytics. 

SEO implementation idea: 

The big thing I think I would try to focus on is plainly labeling headers with proper information that will be noticed by crawlers. I think it would also be important to create backlinks to services being utilized within the project (in this project's case: the Jikan API and the website myanimelist.net). But I think the biggest thing I would need to focus on would be site functionality, and useability, I think these two things can help gain the traction for the website as people who are satisfied with the functionality of the website and ease of access will most likely spread the website through word of mouth.
